      <p>
        A kitten is a juvenile cat. After being born, kittens display primary
        altriciality and are fully dependent on their mothers for survival.
        <br /> They normally do not open their eyes for seven to ten days.
        <br /> After about two weeks, kittens develop quickly and begin to
        explore the world outside their nest.
